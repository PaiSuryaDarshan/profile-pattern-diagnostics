# About the example data

The datasets included in this directory are entirely synthetic.

Original project data cannot be shared due to confidentiality and ownership constraints associated with the commercial context in which Profile Pattern Diagnostics (PPD) was developed.

In the interest of responsible disclosure, all example inputs, databases, and outputs provided here have therefore been artificially generated to reflect plausible structural patterns without reproducing or implying access to real individuals, organisations, or proprietary assessments.

These synthetic examples are intended solely to:

- demonstrate the expected input and output formats,
- illustrate the range of structural profile patterns detected by PPD,
- support testing, inspection, and reproducibility.
- They should not be interpreted as representative of any real cohort or evaluation process.
