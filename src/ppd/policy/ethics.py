"""
Ethical and usage constraints for Profile Pattern Diagnostics (PPD).

PPD is a diagnostic framework intended to describe structural patterns
in rubric-based skill profiles. It is explicitly non-prescriptive.

The system is not designed or intended to:
- make hiring, screening, or selection decisions,
- rank individuals or predict performance outcomes,
- infer intent, potential, or suitability,
- replace human judgement or organisational policy.

All outputs are descriptive and must be interpreted by qualified users
within appropriate contextual, legal, and organisational frameworks.

Cohort-level analyses are provided for contextualisation only and must
not be used to justify exclusionary or automated decision-making.
